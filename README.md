# Java Calculator Application

## Overview
This Java application serves as a basic yet robust calculator capable of performing simple arithmetic operations. It's designed to help users easily calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division results based on their input. The application handles division by zero and invalid operator inputs gracefully, making it both user-friendly and error-resistant.

## Features
- **Basic Operations**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles division by zero and invalid operator inputs.
- **User Input**: Allows users to input two operands and choose an arithmetic operator.
- **Interactive Interface**: Uses the console for input and output, providing a straightforward user experience.

## Java-Specific Features
- **Java Scanner**: For reading user input.
- **Double Data Type**: To handle numerical operations.
- **Switch Expression**: Modern Java feature for cleaner conditional logic.
- **String Handling**: For operator input and validation.

## Usage
1. **Start the Application**: Run the `Main` class to start the application.
2. **Enter Operands**: When prompted, enter two numerical values. These will act as the operands for the calculation.
3. **Select an Operator**: Choose an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) for the desired arithmetic operation.
4. **View the Result**: The application will display the result of the operation or an appropriate error message in cases like division by zero or invalid operator input.

## Purpose
The Java Calculator Application is an excellent tool for anyone looking to understand basic arithmetic operations in Java, handling user input, and implementing switch expressions for decision making. It's particularly useful for beginners in Java programming, demonstrating fundamental concepts in a practical, interactive way.
